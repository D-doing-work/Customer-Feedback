# Customer-Feedback
During my time in LinkedIn, my manager tasked me with a project to find the % of people having trouble with chat experience. We decided to tackle this by seeing what the issues they were having, and which one we should focus on. This finding helped the product operations act with engineering to improve the way our chat feature works.
